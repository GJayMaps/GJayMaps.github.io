<p class=MsoNormal>The whitepaper in which I outlined the initial conception of
ProjSpec was largely written in 1998, then revised in 2000.  Now, to me, it has
the feel of being dated.   Yes, it accurately anticipated the importance of XML
and of Web apps, but it necessarily had to await the emergence of some new
technologies and improvement in my understanding of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technologies have emerged (or just have become apparent to
me) which begin to complete the description of what we have come to call S/A/F
(Smart Adaptive Framework).  It is a less geeky name and one more descriptive
of its intent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The need for such a product still is apparent.  In the
intervening years, every time I have talked with an executive, a manager, or a
project director, I have asked this question: “What framework or environment do
you use to manage your project(s)?  What app is there for coordinating the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>details, for directing the production, for producing
management information, and for providing executive summaries?”  Now granted,
those individuals don’t constitute a statistically valid sample.  Nevertheless,
not one has had much of an answer – not one!  They all agreed that they could
use such a product, and they admitted that their projects were still generally
run on (in my words) “stamina &amp; good intentions”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following diagram lays out both the technologies needed
to develop an S/A/F and the products which it would produce.  It speculates on
the time frame in which the technologies and products would be expected to
mature (green = currently available, blue = in the midterm, and red = in the
long term).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>XML</b> still remains at the heart of what I call the <b>object</b>
<b>database</b>.  Capturing everything as XML objects is simple and fast, and
it can now rely on the underlying database to store and retrieve them magically
sight unseen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every piece of information (textual, numeric, and graphical)
is captured as an object.  <b>Objects</b> coalesce into larger objects, and
larger objects form into classes of objects.  <b>Attributes</b> can be tossed
onto an object (in a free form manner) and be expected to stick.  Designers and
users of the system do not need to have any a priori knowledge of what
attributes will be appropriate for each object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Search engines</b> and <b>clustering</b> do the retrieval
and categorizing of objects.  These technologies are mature now, produce
accurate results in real time, and will only get better with each passing
year.  With these engines integrated into S/A/F, end-users will view the
clusters of objects based on any combination of attributes.  This leads to the
description of the first product:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>NoteObjects </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>NoteObjects</b>, in its simplest form, provides a
clustered tree-view of related information items, i.e. clustered XMLs.   A
requirement for the NoteObjects app is that it has to be as easy to use as
Notepad (or perhaps Excel – the fact is that MS Project is too complex and has
too much baggage to be used by the average office worker).   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For NoteObjects, picture a version of Notepad in which every
time you enter Carriage Return &lt;CR&gt; at the end of a line, that line of text
is captured as an <b>XML</b> object.  Then with a fast <b>clustering engine</b>
as the basis, users can view clusters of information via a tree control.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Example:  as a manager, information pops into my head
constantly, all day long, which I must remember to convey to my staff members. 
Rather than a paper note, rather than an email, rather than a verbal
instruction, rather than a voicemail, rather than waiting for a meeting, it is
much, much easier to just type in the random thoughts.  NoteObjects would,
behind the scenes, immediately capture the notes as XML objects, and the
objects clustered together in any of several ways, based on the contents of
each note.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I come into work in the morning, I’d use NoteObjects to
display all notes which contain my name in order to see who may be asking me to
do something or what information someone may be asking of me.  Then I might
display all the notes with are related to one particular project in order to
see what kind of activities have been taking place on that project.  I might
display all items which have the words “done”, “finished”, or “completed”.  
(Note:  those would be clustered and presented to me, not a keyword search by
me nor having to know how to invoke some stored SQL.)   I might display on
percent done.  I might display on any of dozens and dozens of attributes.  The <b>significant</b>
point is that no one had to a priori define what these attributes are.  <b>Search
engines </b>and spell checkers now search on “sounds like”, “near miss”, “means
a similar thing”, etc.  Thus users are allowed to throw attributes into the mix
in the manner that their business labels things.  A similar<b> significant
point </b>is that the attributes are in the terminology of the company’s
culture and business model, not in computer-geek-speak which historically
database applications have imposed on the users.</p>

<p class=NormalDoubleSpace style='line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Visualization Engine </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There has to be an intuitive way to graphically see the
objects in relation to each other and to have the <b>objects colored</b> based <b>on</b>
the <b>type of attribute</b> and it <b>current values</b>.  There has to be an
intuitive way to watch the objects grow or wane (become more important or less
important), glow or dim (based on the magnitude of attribute values), change
shape (as the information about the object is relatively complete, relatively
incomplete, or skewed in one direction or the other).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The graphics must be <b>3-dimensional</b>.  It is actually a
multi-dimensional problem, but we humans see things in three dimensions.  So
there has to be a way to “<b>walk through the model</b>”, i.e. see different
dimensions from different angles, to look downward to get a <b>high-level macro
view</b> of the project, to take a <b>ground level view of the relative
position of objects </b>around you and look up from beneath to get an <b>under-surface
view of the model infrastructure</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>connections </b>between objects are extremely
important, as significant as the objects themselves.   Each connection between
any two objects must have attributes of its own, i.e. the direction of the
connection, whether it is bi-directional, strength or tenuousness of the
connection, time and expense related to the flow of information between
objects.  The line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) and thickness of the
line are determined by the strength and nature of the connection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The product is a tool for visualizing the essence of complex
projects, a model that “forms itself up”.  To use it would be intuitive and
easy, with a mode for “walking through” the model.  The reality is that every
project becomes exceedingly complex even within hours, certainly within a few
days – such a capability would be invaluable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That complexity inevitably surpasses the ability of
individuals to keep track of all the details and follow the intricate web of
connections.  Therefore flexible visualization apps are needed to expand this
capability for the user.  Two technologies exist to assist in this effort –
integrated with the graphics they become analysis tools, i.e. products of S/A/F
–  <b>XTM</b> and <b>FCM</b> – XML Topic Maps and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. 
Integrated with network routing algorithms, they’ll show logical paths through
the connections, giving the user the ability to see the connections that have
been made, or should be made, are significant, or are insignificant, are taking
on more significance all the time, or are diminishing in importance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A “philosophy” of S/A/F could be that every object be
considered in its own right as a <b>Web Service.</b>  In this concept, every
object “announces” to the overall system:  “here I am”, “this is what I do”,
“this is what I need”, “who wants what I offer?”, “who has what I need?” 
Objects “negotiate” with each other, “interact” with each other, form
connections with each other, etc.  In this manner objects grow or wane as do
organisms in other complex systems.  When a significant thing happens to an
object or when a significant connection is made, then the system sends messages
and flashes signals, so users’ attention is drawn to the area where they should
be paying attention.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Business Outputs </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the central product delivered by S/A/F – business
outputs to every business function across the enterprise.  We are in the
business of process modeling, project modeling, decision modeling, business
modeling, and the output from the system must focus on business products –
summaries, totals, status, budgets, time lines, resource requirements,
progress, logjams, revenue tracking, notification of what is working,
notification of what is missing – the business products needed by business
decision makers to keep their projects on track and get their products to
market ahead of their competitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The system has to start producing those products from the
outset.  Note the green, blue, red shading in the diagram – useful products
from the inception, expanded projects in the mid-term, advanced products in the
long term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The framework, just by collecting, clustering, and
classifying information, is enough to take most employees and their projects
over-the-top – increasing success, productivity, profits.  In and of itself,
that is sufficient to justify development, distribution, and adoption by the
market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The exponential payback is when decision engines go beyond
just organizing data and effective visualization.  When decision engines
undergird growing, evolving, adaptive models is when project members can expect
to be pointed to critical points and emerging problems (in a relatively
unstable, still emerging model) and to efficiencies and high payoff points (in
a mature, relatively stable, but always evolving model).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What will fuel this decision engine?  Fuzzy logic?  Bayesian
logic?  Neural processing?   I expect a hybrid of these, combined with other
advances with which at this point I am just not aware.  This is not an area in
which I profess any great expertise, but what is certain is that just over the
horizon there is going to be sufficient processing power to handle it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How expansive should a claim of market potential be for this
product?  With a product as easy to use as Notepad, visualization that is
intuitive for everyone to see and use, business outputs and guidance for every
business unit in the enterprise, tight integration with MS Office suite, models
built on robust, adaptive, believable decision engines, all in the terminology
homegrown in each business … there is no reason not to believe that the
potential is for it to be used in every office in every business worldwide, all
of which can benefit from:</p>
