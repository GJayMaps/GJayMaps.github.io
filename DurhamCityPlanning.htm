<P><B>While I was a graduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, I worked as a programmer in the Durham City Planning Department.  The planning director had become so frustrated by unfulfilled requests of the city's mainframe IT/Data department that he decided to purchase a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">mini-computer</FONT> for his department and hire planning students to program it.  That was a revolutionary idea at that time, and when he used departmental funds to procure a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">DEC PDP-11</FONT>, it was literally the only one anywhere between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.</B></TD>

<B><P>I programmed an <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">automated map planimeter</FONT> program, with which the planning technicians could make map measurements and area calculations on maps of various scales using a tablet digitizer.  I also wrote programs to plot the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Census DIME maps</FONT> of the Durham metropolitan area and to report summary census tract <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">demographic statistics</FONT>.</B></TD>

<B><P>For all the attention and praise that these graphics applications invariably got, the most significant programming lesson I learned was so very fundamental.   It was that <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">in-line technical documentation of source code</FONT> is what differentiates software from hacker code to professional quality software.  In the second year, I was asked to revise and enhance the planimeter code which I had written in the first year.  When I looked at my own code, I could not make any sense of my own logic and had to painfully retrace the program step by step to re-learn it.  Thus, I learned that documentation is not for the next guy, but it is for yourself, because six months later, you will not be proficient on your own code without it.  Phase II of the planimeter program was completed with thorough documentation and that is a programming standard that I have taken with me to all subsequent projects through my career.</B> </TD>
