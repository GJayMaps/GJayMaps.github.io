        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">In anticipation of the move to the
        new Linus Pauling Middle School, the &quot;It's All About Change&quot;
        banners were created by Carol Nelson's math classes at Westland Middle
        School in the spring of 2004.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kerry
        proposed the design for the project and led the students in making the
        blocks for the banners.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Why art in math class?</b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>During the project, students got a real world taste of how
        math applies to everyday life, especially art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They did the math necessary to calculate how large the banners
        should be, and how large each collage block should be, keeping in mind
        that 230 students would each be making one block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They extrapolated from architect's drawings how high the wall
        would be, determined from class experiments how high the average middle
        school student could jump, and deduced how high the banners should hang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>They calculated the yardage and supplies necessary for the
        project, and estimated the cost of the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b>The theme of change</b> reflects
  the changes that the students have found in their new school environment, and
  the changes that they will see in their environment and in themselves as they
  grow up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The theme is visually
  represented by the four ancient elements of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water, and
  each student interpreted their element in a fabric collage block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many students also learned to use an iron for the first time as they
  fused their fabric shapes to a heat-sensitive backing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The collages were covered by a layer of sheer nylon tulle netting, and
  stitched into place by Ms. McFall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:always">
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b>A traditional quilt pattern</b>
  sometimes known as &quot;birds in flight&quot; was used as a base to construct
  the banner, featuring blocks with triangles arranged much like the V-shaped
  configurations we see in the Willamette Valley sky when migrating geese fly
  overhead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
  coincidentally, the triangle is the letter of the Greek alphabet
  &quot;delta&quot;, which means change or difference in mathematical symbolism.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b>The words on the banner</b>
  represent a translation of the element's name into the languages spoken by
  students in this school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  translations were provided by the English as a Second Language class, and
  represent some of the 16 languages spoken here.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<b>But what about Duct Tape?</b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Alert students will notice that the Duct Tape banner (made to
  illustrate Mr. Stephen's thesis that duct tape is the missing Fifth Ancient
  Element) is not hanging with the other four.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>At this writing, it's not sure where this banner will find its home
  here at Linus Pauling, but the science rooms are a good bet!</font></p>
